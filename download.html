##Quick guide Plaque 2.0



# Compiled version installation Mac OS X (tested on OS X 10.9 Mavericks)


* Unzip the file you have downloaded


* Run Plaque2_mcr for offline and Plaque2_web for online installation 
This should start the setup application. The wait time will vary depending on the machine you are using.
 
* Press next  


* Specify the path to install Plaque2.0 software to and press next. By default the application is installed into /Applications/Plaque2 folder


* Specify the path  to install MATLAB Runtime Compiler (MCR) which is required for Plaque2.0 installation(default path /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime ). If you have chosen 
Plaque2_web installer MCR will start downloading automatically.


* Choose yes to agree to the Licence Agreement and press next


* Press Install to start the installation and wait for it to complete. 


* Press finish to close the installer


# Operation (on sample images example)


* Open Plaque2.app from the installed path (default path: /Applications/Plaque2/application/Plaque2.app)


* Wait for the software to load. The wait time will vary depending on the machine you are using. Software will load with already optimized parameters for sample images.


* Once the Plaque2.0 window appears you can test the workflow of Plaque2.0 on the embedded sample data in following steps for each of the modules:

*Stitching
1. Activate the checkbox at the “Stitch” module in the upper left part of the window and press the button “Stitch” located to the right of the checkbox.
2. Press “Test Settings” button located below the panel to the right of the “Stitch” button - a new window will open.
3. In the new window press “Go To” button - the image from the selected well demonstrating the result of stitching will appear.


*Mask

2. In the panel to the right of the button select the image masking method, e.g. “Automatic Mask Definition” 
3. Press “Test Settings” button located below the panel - a new window will open.
4. In the new window press “Go To” button - the image from the selected well demonstrating the result of image masking will appear as semi-transparent red overlay on top of the original image.


*Monolayer
1. Activate the checkbox at the “Monolayer” module in the upper left part of the window and press the button “Monolayer” located to the right of the checkbox.
