# Installation, Getting started and getting Help with Plaque 2.0

The Plaque 2.0 software is intended for quantification  and visualization of viral spread in cell mono-layers. Plaque2.0 will be available as MATLAB source code or as precompiled for  various platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux - see [Download](download.html) section) software based on MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR). The software is available under the (GPLv3)[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html] license. MCR based version doesn't require MATLAB license to run, however it requires download of the MCR from Mathworks website, which will occur automatically during the installation process.

If you are using the MCR based version the software installer will guide you through MCR download. Be aware, that it requires connection to the internet during the installation procedure. A version including the MCR into the installation may be made available upon request.

Upon installation you will have to locate the application in the folder you specified during the installation and start the executable file. Since some platforms do not support MCR splash screen (Mac, Linux) you might not receive immediate feedback upon starting the executable file. Therefore keep in mind that as with any other application it might take certain time to load the file and open the graphical user interface.

The graphical user interface (GUI) consists of four sections: input/output parameters, analysis flags, parameters and log sections . The software workflow is as follows. First, user specifies the input and output folders of the images to be analyzed with corresponding file tags. Then user chooses from the analysis flags section which of the analysis steps he would like to perform. Afterwards, the user specifies the required parameters in each of the selected analysis steps.

Current settings can be tested by pressing “Test Settings” button in the corresponding analysis step tab. After all parameters have been set user starts the analysis by pressing “Run” button on the input/output panel.

All the output of the software including errors are displayed in the log section. Log then can be save to a file or cleared by pressing respectively “Save” and “Clear” buttons. If the analysis was successful the results of the analysis are exported to the specified “Result Output Folder” as image based and object based readout tables in .xlsx, .csv and .mat.

## Operation 

Plaque 2.0 software contains four distinct, interconnected analysis modules: Stitching, Masking, Monolayer and Plaque segmentation.  Let's discuss each of these analysis modules individually and in more detail.
 
_Stitching_ module is responsible for merging together the individual well site images together into a single image. The images are read from the  provided _Input Folder_  using the _Filename pattern_ which is defined as a MATLAB regular expression. `(?<wellName>[A-Z][0-9]*)` , `(?<siteName>s[0-9]*)`, `(?<channelName>w[0-9]*)` are tokens which are used to identify where the software needs to read well,site and channel metadata in the file name. More information about regular expressions is available at [MATLAB regular expression help page](http://ch.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/regular-expressions.html). This is currently optimized for the output naming convention of the _Molecular Devices_ microscopes.  After the images are read they are sorted by alphabetical order and merged into single image taking into account the number of vertical and horizontal images comprising an image and saved to the  _Processing Folder_.

All the other modules read images from the _Processing Folder_ with the _Filename pattern_ defined in the _Input/Output_ panel. If the meta-data from the filenames is read correctly a drop-down menu for appropriate channel selection is generated. The channels for each module have to be defined by the user.

_Masking_ module is responsible for creating an overlay mask over the stitched image. This is done to prevent any segmentation of image data outside the region of interest. Three different options are currently available in Plaque 2.0 for mask definition. As a first option, one can load an already predefined mask from an external file by providing its path in the _Custom Mask File_ edit box. The second option is _Manual Mask detection_ which lets user specify an oval region of interest over the first image in the _Processing Folder_. The Third options is _Automatic Mask Detection_ which identifies the well using the center of the mass of the over-segmented image and  draws a circle around it with a certain radius. This radius is pre-defined for  Greiner 96-well imaging plates. Both manual and automatic  mask detection methods are to be generalized and improved in future versions of Plaque 2.0.

_Monolayer_ module is responsible for quantification of nuclei signal images.  The segmentation is done in a pipeline fashion. First images are loaded from _Processing Folder_ and depending on user preference illumination correction is performed as at mid-range magnification non-linear illumination effects might occur. Illumination correction is done using the "rolling ball" background subtraction algorithm. The radius of the ball is defined by the <i>Correction &#34;ball&#34; radius</i> parameter. On the next step the image is filtered  of very bright artifacts using _Artifact threshold_. The resulting image is then again thresholded using either manual or automatic (local or global Otsu) methods. If the selected method is global Otsu thresholding the resulted threshold is further corrected by _Minimal threshold_ and _Correction factor_ parameters.  In case of local Otsu thresholding user is required to specify the  _Block size_ parameter which determines the sides of square regions that the image is divided to. The regions then are thresholded using the same Otsu thresholding algorithm. 
After foreground pixels are identified the software quantifies the amount of nuclei present in the well. This is done by simply dividing the sum of all non-zero pixels in the thresholded image to the mean area of nuclei determined from predefined minimum and maximum nuclei areas.
Here is an example of a thresholded nuclear image:

![](img/nuc.png)

Virus segmentation module is responsible for quantification of virus signal images. Unlike nuclei signal images, foreground determination is done by using a fixed threshold. The reason for this is to keep the resulting readouts  of quantification comparable among different wells as much as possible.  After the foreground is determined, neighboring pixels are connected using the _Connectivity_  parameter. This generates  a "bloated" connected image which is then used to determine  if a set pixels belongs to a certain region. The labeled regions are then filtered by pixel area using the specified _Minimal Plaque Area_. The determined regions are called plaque regions.  Here how a sample image looks after quantification:
![](img/vir_thresh.png)
If the _Fine Detection_ option is enabled the software tries to further quantify and identify local intensity maxima of the detected plaque regions. To achieve this first all the detected plaque regions are smoothed using a 2-D Gaussian function.

![](img/samplePlaque.png)

For example this image of a plaque(represented in intensity color-code) is converted into 

![](img/samplePlaqueFiltered.png)

This is  then proceeded by search of local maxima in within already identified plaque regions. The _Peak Region Size_  defines a maximum size of a region in pixels where only one intensity maximum can be detected. In the resulting image maximum regions are presented as red regions.
