## PyPlaque python library

We now have started working on a Python 3 library for plaque analysis. Very first release has just been made available on: [https://pypi.org/project/PyPlaque/](https://pypi.org/project/PyPlaque/). The source code is available under [https://github.com/plaque2/PyPlaque](https://github.com/plaque2/PyPlaque).

## About

Developed in 1950s, plaque assay started the era of the quantitative virology, allowing precise tittering and subsequent purification of infectious units from inoculae of various etiologies. However more than a means to titer viruses, *plaque assay* delivers phenotypes bearing information about the life cycle and spreading mechanism of viruses. Recent advance in automated high-throughput imaging and sCMOS camera technologies together with state-of-the-art image analysis algorithms can help harnessing this information. Here we present **Plaque2.0** – an assay framework bridging high-throughput high resolution midrange magnification imaging accompanied by image analysis software aimed at enabling researchers to maximize information they obtain from their plaque assays.

## Current Release: 2.0141118

The most recent version of the software is available in dev branch on GitHub for forking, cloning and download under GPLv3 open source license from [github.com/plaque2](http://github.com/plaque2).
