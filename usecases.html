# Comparisons of Plaque2.0 assay to the Conventional Plaque Assay for Various Mammalian Viruses and Tissue Cultures

Conventional plaque assay and Plaque2.0 were compared using viruses of different genera: Human Adenovirus (HAdV) strain C2 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) from cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (HAdV-C2_dE3B_GFP), wild type Human Rhinovirus genotypes A1A (HRV-A1A) and A16 (HRV-A16), Vaccinia virus (VACV) - strains Western Reserve (WR) and International Health Department J (IHD-J) both expressing GFP from early and late promoters (E/L GFP) and Herpes Simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) expressing GFP from CMV promoter (Fig. 1-6).

## Human Adenovirus type C2 expressing GFP under CMV promoter (HAdV-C2_dE3B_GFP)

In case of HAdV-C2_dE3B_GFP we performed the conventional assay both in liquid and gelled media in 6-well plates (each well 35 mm in diameter) (Fig. 1a). Cells were PFA fixed 7 days post infection and stained with crystal violet (CV). Similar to reported in 19 comet tail formation was stopped by gelling the medium, while the circular plaques were formed by HAdV particles diffusing through agarose. For the Plaque2.0 assay of HAdV we used 384 (Fig. 1b) and 96-well (Fig. 1c) imaging plates and liquid medium. In the end of the assay plate was fixed with 4% PFA and stained with Hoechst nuclear dye. Liquid medium resulted in comet shaped plaques, harnessing the intensity information allowed, however, to distinguishing comets from one another. In case of conventional assay, overlapping comets significantly lowered the ability to distinguish individual phenotypes. However in case of Plaque2.0 using the intensity dimension of the GFP transgenic virus one can easily identify bright centers of the individual comets even if they overlap with tails of other comets. Although formation of comet tails can be circumvented by gelling the medium, a setup like that, though compatible with 96-well plates (and 384 well plates, data not shown), limits the potential use of perturbations with drugs or siRNA in the assay and makes the liquid handling in a high-throughput assay much more laborious. We were also able to shorten the duration of the assay in Plaque2.0 (4 days instead of 7) through using midrange magnification microscopy.

## Human Rhinoviruses A1A and A16

In case of HRV-A1A and HRV-A16 (Fig. 2 and 3) we have performed conventional assay following similar protocol in both liquid and gelled medium in HeLa cells cultivated as monolayers. Next plates were scanned using flatbed office scanner with 600 ppi resolution. To visualize plaques in Plaque2.0 using midrange magnification fluorescence microscopy we employed either immunofluorescence staining against viral protein using anti-VP1 antibody or RNA FISH staining.

## Vaccinia virus strain Westeern Reserve early/late GFP (VACV-WR-E/L-GFP)

In case of VACV-WR-E/L-GFP both conventional and Plaque2.0 plates (Fig. 4) were fixed 24 h post infection (pi) yielding large plaques with distinct lesions in the middle, observable both in nuclear stain (Hoechst) and the GFP signal. The plaque size of Plaque2.0 was comparable with the size of plaques of the conventional assay fixed at 24 h pi. However the fluorescence intensity of GFP signal allowed distinguishing the borders of the overlapping plaques. This concept is supported by our previously published observation that brightness of GFP produced by transgenic viruses are dependent on both time post infection and amount of virus inoculum 19. Hence the intensity information may be used to improve the segmentation of individual plaques in Plaque2.0.

## Vaccinia virus strain International Health Department J early/late GFP (VACV-IHD-J-E/L-GFP)

In case of VACV-IHD-J-E/L-GFP we have performed the conventional and Plaque2.0 assays in liquid medium (Fig. 5). This resulted in the formation of comet phenotypes, tails of which presumably resulted from extracellular enveloped (EEV) particles undergoing convection in the liquid medium, similar to our experiments performed with HAdV 19. This assumption was challenged in further assays with VACV (see full manuscript). The VACV-IHD-J-E/L-GFP Plaque2.0 plate was fixed at 12 h pi (hence smaller spreading phenotypes). Although the lesions are smaller, they are still distinguishable by fluorescence microscopy. This allowed decreasing the duration of the assay two fold (12h incubation instead of 24h). Furthermore, in case of VACV-IHD-J-E/L-GFP we have also acquired the full wells in wide field mode using transmission light microscopy (Fig. 5). We have corrected the illumination in the transmission light channel using fast Fourrier transform band-pass filtering 31. Although transmission light images provided additional qualitative information about cellular monolayer, we were not able to obtain quantitative cell count data from them through the image analysis methods we have employed.

## Herpes Simplex Virus 1 GFP under CMV promoter

In case of HSV-1-GFP, both conventional assay and Plaque2.0 were carried out in HeLa-ATCC cells monolayers infected with HSV-1 strain C12, expressing GFP under CMV promoter (Fig. 6). Conventional plaque assay was done in 6-well plates in liquid medium. Confluent monolayers of HeLa-ATCC were inoculated with HSV-1-GFP, PFA fixed and stained with crystal violet 7 d pi. Plaque 2.0 assay was PFA (4%) fixed 2 d pi and stained with Hoechst fluorescent dye for nuclear signal.
